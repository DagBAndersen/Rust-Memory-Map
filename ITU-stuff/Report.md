# Bachelor Report

# Intro - abstract
Speed is first priority



## Motivation

What do you do when you want to quickly search through a big data-set that cant be store in ram?
On a small scale the easy answer is to just buy a more powerful machine, but this is maybe not always what you want. Should you choose to run a given service on a virtual machine on a cloud-provider like _digital ocean_ then running a rending a machine with many resources quickly becomes expensive. This is where this problem becomes relevant.

## Problem explained in detail

Siteimprove needs service where they can look up information of a given ip-address. The primary focus is fast lookup so their customers can get a result as fast as possible.
Preprocessing time is not important as long as it doesn't take over day. 
Space wise it doesn't matter much either, but again it has to be a realistic/practical amount.

### Data

Each entry consist of two ip addresses and some related data/payload. The first ip determents the lower bound of the range and the second is the upper bound.

It is not possible to access to the real data due to confidentiality, but the number of entries and the amount of payload pr. entry. is available. 
The system needs to handle 150mil ipv4 ranges and 35mil ipv6 ranges with a payload of 256 bytes.

### Assumptions
* The input data contains no overlapping ranges
* No range/entry contain the same payload?
* No ip range is excluded (No ip range should be ignore because of reserved ip-range-blocks) / in other words... all ip addresses are possible.
* No need to remove or change entries.
* The entries should should be able to be stream into the program so no way of knowing how many entries will actually go into the system

### the goal
Handle 150 mil entries
Siteimprove's wishes for a lookup time of p99 in 60ms.

### Si Rules/Priorities
```
- Language:             Rust.
- Dataset:              A set of IP ranges to firms.
                        No overlapping ranges. 
- Pre-processing-time:  Not important.
                        No new entries after first lookup.
- storage space:        Not important.
- Lookup-time:          Important.
```

### Si goals 
I couldn't test on Siteimprove's real data, since it confidential, but could get 
```
- Dataset:              150.mil ipv4
                        35.mil  ipv6
                        256bytes payload pr entry.
- Memory:               4gb
- Lookup-time:          p99 in 60ms.`
```

### Input Cases
- Payload pr. range
- Distance between ranges
- number of ranges
- Range size
- IPv4 or IPv6
- mutable structure vs. dynamic insertion 

### Test Variables:
- ram 
- Space
- lookup time
- build time

## Why rust?
"Rust is a multi-paradigm system programming language focused on safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C, but is designed to provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance." - wiki

In a survey done by XXX 51% of the security vulnerabilities in the linux kernel is coursed by concurrency and memory safety issues that are fundamentally impossible to get in rust (unless you use the `unsafe` keyword, which is not recommended)

### Memory safety

"Rust is designed to be memory safe, and thus it does not permit null pointers, dangling pointers, or data races in safe code. Data values can only be initialized through a fixed set of forms, all of which require their inputs to be already initialized." - wiki

Guaranteed by Rust's ownership system - At compile time

This means if I have an array `[T]` of items and I init a reference to one of those items `&T` then the that reference needs to go out of scope before the array - otherwise the rust compiler wont compile because it can't guarantee that the array isn't de-allocated or changed before accessing `T`.
This is both a huge challenge when first starting to work with Rust, but also a really great safety.

Since rust have real references that it check and don't really use & "raw pointers" that you move around in C, then i was hoping i could use references on my nodes...

<table><tr><th>
Compiles
</th><th>
Doesn't Compile
</th></tr><tr><td><pre>
pub struct Node {
    pub min_ip: u32,
    pub max_ip: u32,
    pub left: usize,
    pub right: usize,
    pub name: [u8; 32],
}</pre></td><td><pre>
pub struct Node {
    pub min_ip: u32,
    pub max_ip: u32,
    pub left: &Node,    // Error
    pub right: &Node,   // Error
    pub name: [u8; 32],
}</pre></td></tr></table>
Sadly storing pointers/referenes doesn't work, so i opted to just store the byte-index of the node in Tree Memory map. 


### Error handling

```rust
pub(crate) fn get_u32_for_ip(v: &str) -> Option<u32> {
    let v: Vec<&str> = v.split('.').collect();
    if v.len() != 4 { return None }
    let mut min_array: [u8; 4] = Default::default();
    for i in 0..v.len() {
        min_array[i] = match v[i].parse() {
            Ok(n) => n,
            Err(e) => return None
        }
    }
    Some(u32::from_be_bytes(min_array))
}
```
This function takes a string of 4 numbers separated by a dot `.` - e.g. `192.2.103.11` and returns unsigned integer wrapped in a option.

instead of getting of semencation faults and similar, i can specifc
`BufReader::new(File::open(file).expect("Could not find file"))`

### ownership
https://medium.com/@thomascountz/ownership-in-rust-part-1-112036b1126b


`Rust has an ownership system where all values have a unique owner, and the scope of the value is the same as the scope of the owner. Values can be passed by immutable reference, using &T, by mutable reference, using &mut T, or by value, using T. At all times, there can either be multiple immutable references or one mutable reference (an implicit readers-writer lock). The Rust compiler enforces these rules at compile time and also checks that all references are valid.` - wiki
### Where rust falls short
Sadly sometimes we can cant use rust's safety, and this is where rust looks more like C
```rust
pub(crate) unsafe fn bytes_to_type<T>(slice: &[u8]) -> &mut T {
    std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut(slice.as_ptr() as *mut T, std::mem::size_of::<T>())
        .get_mut(0)
        .unwrap()
}
```
Here we have no guarantee of we are going to get, since it just a pointer and a length that we force to become a reference to type T. I this case we don't have any other way, since MememoryMap only know the concept of bytes.

Overall i believe rust is a great language for low level programming and it's safety and guarantees are great, but in some cases it run short when you are working directly on disk.

# Data structures
The usually way of searching through persistent data is usually done by saving it in a database usually consisting of key-value entries stored in tables.

The data for this problem consist of ranges, which means that the choice of database type is not obvious, and depends on different factors. 
It depends on range-size, gap-size (between each range), data-size pr entry, how many keys there can exist in total, and number of entries - and ofc how complicated of a implementation you want. 

For this problem i have chosen to look into tree structures and full-table structures. 

Lets declare some variables:
```
p = payload size in bytes
e = number of entries
```

#### Fixed vs. dynamic payload length 
Depending on the problem you want to solve you can either choose to use the same amount of space for each entry or have a dynamic size meaning you only use the necessary amount of space for each entry. 
Dynamic payload is great, since you don't wast space on empty payload, but the downside is that you have to store "absolute addresses" to where the payload begins instead of only storing which number of  fixed-payload-size-block when referring to the payload.
<insert image>
This means that it sometimes are not beneficial to use dynamic, if amount of pointers to the payload accumulates to a given amount. 

For this project i have chosen dynamic payload length, because the payload consist of names, which can vary a lot in length. If fixed length was chosen i would either have to accept a large amount of wasted space, or not allow names to be over a given length meaning i would cut of names.

## Binary Trees

### introduction

There is many differently ways of structuring each node depending on what the goal is.

* Fixed size nodes, vs. dynamic sized nodes. If you go for fixed size nodes, you only need to store the index of the node and not the full address. (as explained above)
* Wanting a separate lookup table or not. This goes hand in hand with the one above, since you cant have 

![Tree disk usage](../docs/images/bachelor-01.png)

Lets split this up into two problems: _range storage_ and _pointer/payload storage_

Depending on if you want to handle ipv6 or not you have to choose 

##### range storage

##### payloadstorage


```

ipv6 - solution E
30.000.000*232 / 8 /1000/1000/1000 = 0.87gb 

2^32/256

#table2
30.000.000 * 256/1000/1000/1000 = ~7.7gb
```

## Tables

The general understanding is that searching in tables are quicker than most data structures, because you can get the data by going directly to a specific index by using the key. 


The naive implementation of this is to just create a full table for all ip-addresses holding a value for each ip. This obviously result in a massive data duplication because a value is stored repeatedly for each key in the associated range. This can easily be improved by actually storing the payload in another table and only storing the index in the ip_table

holding another key that is used as an address to find the actual value.
<insert image>


# Design


## Payload Map

Both implementations use a separate memory mapped file for storing the payload/data, and the search map will then just use and index to determine where the data is stored on in the file.

![](../docs/images/bachelor-04.png)

**Space**

This means we can calculate the size of this file
`(avg(payload_size_in_bytes)+1) Â· number_of_entries`. `+1` because we need to add the size of the word. 

**Limitations**
calculate the max size for a payload
`2^8 = 256` - this means a entry can store up to 256 bytes. 

If we have 150.000.000 entries with 255 bytes each, we can calculate the largest possible file to be 38.4 gb
```
150.000.000 * 256 = 38.400.000.000 bits
38.400.000.000/1000/1000/1000 = 38.4 gb

This means we have a 

dynamic payload
(34.5-17.3)/(150.000.000/1000/1000/1000) = 114 bytes is the breakpointet.
```
Lookup time is constant. 

----------------------

here we have a simple example of what it would look like if the first entries were
```
0.0.0.50 0.0.0.55 SKAT
0.0.1.20 0.0.1.20 PWC
0.0.0.0 0.0.0.2 Siteimprove
...
```

## Redblack Tree
![](../docs/images/bachelor-02.png)

This tree consist of nodes. these nodes are structs and consist of ...

where the name field is a pointer to the address of the start of the payload stored in the payload_map. 

Each time a entry is added to the tree the a new node will be appended at the end. Because all nodes have the same size, we can point to their index instead of their absolute address.

```rust
pub struct Node {
    pub red: bool,
    pub min_ip: u32,
    pub max_ip: u32,
    pub left: usize,
    pub right: usize,
    pub parent: usize,
    pub name: usize,
}
```
The only difference from a regular tree is the added parent pointer and color boolean.

**Space**
`8(bool)+32+32+64+64+64+64 = 328 bit` pr entry meaning we get a file of `49.200.000.000 bits` which is `49.200.000.000b/8/1000/1000 = 6,15 gb`. 

**Implementation overview:**
``` 
Speed: 2 lookups
Space: <fix bit vs bytes>
    tree_table:     (4 Â· 64 + 2 Â· 32 + 8) Â· e = 328 Â· e
    payload_table:  (1 + p) Â· e
```

**Handling IpV6**
Tree structures handles IpV6 well. The only change nessesary would be to change the `min_ip` and `max_ip` to be a `u32`/`usize`. This would increase all nodes sizes with 2 Â· 32 bits.

---

## Table
![](../docs/images/bachelor-03.png)

This would result in
```
(1+256) Â· 150000000 = 38.550.000.000 bytes = 308.400.000.000 bits
```
This means that 32 bit is not big enough to store all the  
2)


**Space**
best and worst case:
```
(2^32)*32/8/1000/1000/1000 = 17.2 gb
(2^64)*32/8/1000/1000/1000 = 34.4 gb
```
Since we build a full table it doesn't matter how many entries we get - the size will stay the same. 

**Implementation overview:**
``` 
Speed:
    constant time. 2 lookups. O(1).
Storage:
    ip_table: 2^32 * 32
    payload_table: (1 + p) Â· e
```

**Handling IpV6**
This implementation wont work for IpV6.
IpV6 is 128 bit instead of IpV4's 32 bit.
`2^128 = 3,40e38b`
`3,40e38/8/1000/1000 = 4,25e28 gb`
This solution would never work in practice. 

# Testing

The automated test script can be found in appendix X, but the overall structure is explained in this section. 

## Simple unit tests
Most functions are tested by simple unit tests. 


## speed testing
All tests are executed on a droplet (virtual machine) on Digital Ocean (cloud provider), 
Closed envorimentent and fixed resources. 

Test process:
* Copy src files to droplet with `SCP-command`
* 

clear cache between search through


to mimic a real scenario, we you choose to go for such an implementation because of resource limitations.

```
pub fn generate_source_file_with(s:&str, n: u32, range: Range<u32>, padding: Range<u32>, name_size: usize) { ... }
```

## Setup
**Generating test files**
Created a function that generate a text file where each line is 2 IP addresses and 1 name
e.g.: `125.74.3.0 125.74.3.10 Siteimprove` 
each line is written direcly to a file and
and afterwards shuffled by using the unix command `shuf`. It was necessary to print them to the file immediately instead of shuffling them in ram, because all 150 million entries could be in ram at the same time.

## Build
**When running:**
The program iterate over each line reading them one by one with regex. <insert ref here>
This step is derterimistic, so i only need to run this each time i generate a new source file. 

## lookup
**Choosing random lookups**
The lookup ip are collected by running over the shuffled list of entries and collecting every 1000 entry. a random ip is picked between the upper and lower boinds. These ip are then shuffled again and then used for search lookups 

## search


This search through can be parallelized. Should this be used as a real service it can easily be parallix as long as it only reads. 

for testing/benchmarking perposeses the lookups are run sequentile to find the avarage lookup time pr request. 

Both the tree and table search test goes through the same steps:
* generated random requets
* init memory map references
* iterate over the requests check that all of them is found in in the table/tree
* print the result

```rust
#[test]
fn search_time_table() {
    println!("## search_time_table");
    let src = DO_Benchmark_test_src;

    let requests = FileGenerator::generate_lookup_testdata(src,1000);
    let length = requests.len();
    assert!(length > 0);

    let lookup_table = Table::gen_lookup_table();
    let ip_table = Table::gen_ip_table();
    let mut numberSkipped = 0;

    let mut sw = Stopwatch::start_new();
    for (ip, name) in requests {
        let value = Table::find_value_on_map(ip, &lookup_table, &ip_table);
        if value.is_some() {
            let value = value.unwrap();
            if name != value {
                numberSkipped += 1;
                //println!("Wrong match - real: {} - found: {} - ip: {}", name, value, ip);
            }
        } else { println!("Found none - real name: {} - ip: {}", name, ip) }
    }
    sw.stop();
    println!("--- table score : {}, #{} of requests ran, #{} skipped", sw.elapsed().as_micros(), length, numberSkipped);
}
```

### Optimizations 

A huge part of the performance came from using a profiler
The profiler used for this project was the build-in profiler-tool in _Jetbrains Clion_, which is Jetbrains low-level-programming IDE. 

<Get better images>

![treeprofiler](../docs/images/treeProfiler.png)
![tableprofiler](../docs/images/tableProfiler.png)

<nÃ¦vn noget om hvilken type profiling det er >
This was mainly used for seeing how much time the process spend in each scope/stackframe/function to find bottlenecks.

## Test Results

```
## search_time_tree
DO_BenchmarkTests::search_time_tree
--- Tree : #79213144 micro seconds, #149850 of requests ran, #0 failed
114.919801097 seconds time elapsed

## search_time_table
DO_BenchmarkTests::search_time_table
--- table : #105057148 micro seconds, #149850 of requests ran, #0 failed
```
This means i am able to process 149850 ip adress request in 105057148 micro seconds milliseconds, which is XXX request/milliseconds


# Evaluation

Both table and the tree was under goal given from Siteimprove. 


The table is clearly not practical for handling ipV6
The table has duplicated data


## Code wise?



## design choices?



## Test Data


## Cache 

In theory the cache shouldn't matter if the data-set consists of an infinitely large amount of entires, because the cache would be thrashed anyways.

but on a more realistic scale (like in this project) this can become a factor when i comes to speed.

The immediate thought would be that the tree would benefit from this, since the nodes closer to the root would be read much more often than the rest of the tree, meaning that the data stored in the upper nodes can be retrieved from the cache. 

For testing the cache i used linux command `perf stat -e task-clock,cycles,instructions,cache-references,cache-misses [input]` on the droplet. 

It is difficult to isolate the cache-miss counting to the searchign only. This means the 3 results include generating the searh input, searchin in table/tree, and looking it up in the payload_table. This means that generating and looking in payloads_table should be stable for all 3 tests, 

The tress always hit around 30% cache-miss. 
the table vary from 30-60% cache miss, depending on if the compiler made optimizations and on higher

### Enchantments / Next Steps 

* Upgrade to redblack tree
* Actually adding a nice api, instead of only running the code through testfuctions/benchmarks.
* No reason to individually place each enty to the ip_table... i could just add them to an array in memory and then place that on disk
