# Designing/implementing/evaluating an external map in Rust on modern hardware

## Problem Formulation

## Learning Outcomes - After the course the student should be able to:
- Learn how to lay out a data structure on desk
- Make the program get data from a static source
- Make the program respond to get requests in reasonable time.
- Organize, plan, and carry out solo work in a a solo group.
- Identify, define and delimit a problem in software development (i.e., prepare a problem statement);
- Identify and analyze relevant options, such as methods, libraries, data structures and algorithms
- Compare the relevant options for the application at hand, selecting the most suited ones based on their theoretical and practical performance.
- Systematically test the product (i.e, black box test several modules, white box test at least one critical piece of code);

- Describe how a memory map can be stored on desk and why it is useful.
- Identify and analyze relevant options, such as language, methods, libraries
- Describe and analyse data structures and algorithms necessary fit for using a Memory map.
- Design/implement/evaluate an external map in Rust on modern hardware


#### Words to use
explain
list
Describe
demonstrate
calculate
report
compare

## Method
The method is experimental. We will design, implement and evaluate a prototype.

## What will be handed in
A report containing system design, results and discussion.
