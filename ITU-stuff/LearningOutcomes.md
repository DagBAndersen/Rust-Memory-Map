## Problem Formulation

xyz

## Intended Learning Outcomes:
- Analyze the requirements from siteimprove in terms of persistent log and key-value store
- Describe and analyze existing data structures and algorithms for persistent log and key-value stores
- Design/implement/evaluate a persistent log and key-value store in Rust on modern hardware

## Method
The method is experimental. We will design, implement and evaluate a prototype.

## What will be handed in
A report containing system design, results and discussion.
